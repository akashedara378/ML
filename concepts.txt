Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models 
that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, they learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

types:

Supervised Learning: The model learns from labeled data. It’s used for classification and regression tasks.

Unsupervised Learning: The model learns from unlabeled data. It’s used for clustering and association tasks.

Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment to achieve a goal, improving through trial and error.
